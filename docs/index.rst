Reinforcement Learning python library
-------------------------------------

.. highlight:: python

MushroomRL is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) library that aims to be a simple, yet
powerful way to make **RL** and **deep RL** experiments. The idea behind Mushroom
consists in offering the majority of RL algorithms providing a common interface
in order to run them without excessive effort. Moreover, it is designed in such
a way that new algorithms and other stuff can generally be added transparently
without the need of editing other parts of the code. MushroomRL makes a large use
of the environments provided by
`OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>`_,
`DeepMind Control Suite <https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control>`_ and
`MuJoCo <http://www.mujoco.org/>`_ libraries, and
the `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org>`_ library for tensor computation.

With MushroomRL you can:

- solve RL problems simply writing a single small script;
- add custom algorithms and other stuff transparently;
- use all RL environments offered by well-known libraries and build customized
  environments as well;
- exploit regression models offered by Scikit-Learn or build a customized one
  with PyTorch;
- run experiments on GPU.

Basic run example
-----------------
Solve a discrete MDP in few a lines. Firstly, create a **MDP**:

::

    from mushroom_rl.environments import GridWorld

    mdp = GridWorld(width=3, height=3, goal=(2, 2), start=(0, 0))

Then, an epsilon-greedy **policy** with:

::

    from mushroom_rl.policy import EpsGreedy
    from mushroom_rl.utils.parameters import Parameter

    epsilon = Parameter(value=1.)
    policy = EpsGreedy(epsilon=epsilon)
                                
Eventually, the **agent** is:

::

    from mushroom_rl.algorithms.value import QLearning

    learning_rate = Parameter(value=.6)
    agent = QLearning(mdp.info, policy, learning_rate)

Learn: 

::

    from mushroom_rl.core.core import Core

    core = Core(agent, mdp)
    core.learn(n_steps=10000, n_steps_per_fit=1)

Print final Q-table:

::

    import numpy as np

    shape = agent.Q.shape
    q = np.zeros(shape)
    for i in range(shape[0]):
        for j in range(shape[1]):
            state = np.array([i])
            action = np.array([j])
            q[i, j] = agent.Q.predict(state, action)
    print(q)


Results in:

::

    [[  6.561   7.29    6.561   7.29 ]
     [  7.29    8.1     6.561   8.1  ]
     [  8.1     9.      7.29    8.1  ]
     [  6.561   8.1     7.29    8.1  ]
     [  7.29    9.      7.29    9.   ]
     [  8.1    10.      8.1     9.   ]
     [  7.29    8.1     8.1     9.   ]
     [  8.1     9.      8.1    10.   ]
     [  0.      0.      0.      0.   ]]

where the Q-values of each action of the MDP are stored for each rows
representing a state of the MDP.
