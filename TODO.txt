Algorithms:
    * Policy Search:
        - Natural gradient
        - NES
        - Constrained REPS
        - MORE
        - PAPI

For Mushroom 2.0:
    * Record method in environemnt and record option in the core
    * Simplify Regressor interface: drop GenericRegressor, remove facade pattern
    * vectorize basis functions and simplify interface, simplify facade pattern
    * remove custom save for plotting, use Serializable
    * support multi-objective RL
    * Register environments to build them from string with default parameters
    * Improve replay memory, allowing to store arbitrary information into replay buffer
